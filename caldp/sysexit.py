"""This module defines context managers which are used to trap exceptions
and exit Python cleanly with specific exit_codes which are then seen as
the numerical exit status of the process and ultimately Batch job.

The exit_on_exception() context manager is used to bracket a block of code
by mapping all exceptions onto some log output and a call to sys.exit():

    with exit_on_exception(exit_codes.SOME_CODE, "Parts of the ERROR", "message output", "on exception."):
        ... the code you're trapping to SOME_CODE when things go wrong ...

The exit_on_exception() manager also enables simulating errors by defining the
CALDP_SIMULATE_ERROR=N environment variable.  When the manager is called with a
code matching CALDP_SIMULATE_ERROR, instead of running the code block it fakes
an exception by performing the corresponding log output and sys.exit() call.  A
few error codes are simulated more directly, particularly memory errors.

The exit_receiver() manager is used to bracket the top level of your code,
nominally main(), and land the SystemExit() exception raised by
exit_on_exception() after the stack has been unwound and cleanup functions
performed.  exit_receiver() then exits Python with the error code originally
passed into exit_on_exception().
